The provided Python script is designed to generate README files for each subdirectory in a given source directory. It does this by checking if the subdirectory contains an existing README.MD file. If not, it converts the Jupyter notebook file present in that subdirectory into a string format and then uses a language model (LLM) to generate a detailed README file content based on that notebook's code. The generated content includes information about the competition, the problem to be solved, links to the competition on Kaggle, a description of the competition problem, and libraries used in solving it. Finally, the script writes this generated content into a new README.MD file within each subdirectory.
